If you want to compile all the files from the command line without makefiles, use
the following command << gcc main.c hello.c factorial.c -o hello >>.

Makefiles have the following syntax:

target: dependencies
[tab] system command

Use << make >> command to run a makefile.

If you have multiple makefiles run the command << make -f make_file_name >>.
